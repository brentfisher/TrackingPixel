TrackingPixel
=============

NodeJS tracking pixel

If you're looking to clone this, go ahead and install MongoDB, (brew install mongodb, for my fellow mac users), and use the default ports.

I didn't add <a href="https://github.com/remy/nodemon">Nodemon</a> as a part of my package, but I suggest you use this to monitor when you make changes.

Also, I would personall install express globally (npm install express -g).
